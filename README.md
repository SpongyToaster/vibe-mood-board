# 🎨 Vibe Mood Board Generator  
_A 2-hour browser-based coding adventure with help from AI tools_

---

## 📚 Overview

Welcome to your **vibe-coding** lab. You’re not here to write code from scratch — you’re here to **think like a creator**, describe what you want, and let an AI help you build it. In this project, you’ll design your own **mood board** app using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

💡 **Tools you'll use:**
- AI Assistants like **ChatGPT**, **GitHub Copilot**, or **Google Gemini**
- Your own browser
- A single `index.html` file

---

## 🚀 What You’ll Build

A one-page app where you can:
- Add image URLs, color swatches, and notes
- Display “vibe cards” on a flexible board
- Save your board using `localStorage`
- Export/import your board as a `.json` file
- Work in a single `index.html` file — no frameworks or setups needed

---

## 🧠 Starter Prompt (Copy & Paste into ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot)

✨ I'm vibe-coding a fun, self-contained HTML mood board app. Help me build a single index.html with embedded HTML, CSS, and JS. I should be able to:

🖼️ Add image URLs, color swatches, and notes
🧱 Display cards on the board
💾 Save to localStorage
📤 Export/import JSON
♿ Keep it accessible, mobile-friendly, and responsive
🚫 Use no external libraries

📝 Include brief comments in the code and tell me 2 edge cases I should test.


✅ Once pasted, ask the AI to walk you through the code, help debug, or add extra features!


✅ Paste that into **ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, or describe it to **GitHub Copilot** in a code comment.

## 🌟 Bonus Challenges (Pick One or More!)

- Add a **delete** or **edit** button for cards
- Filter cards by **color** or **keyword**
- Add **dark mode** toggle
- Include drag-and-drop reordering
- Style your layout with **Flexbox** or **Grid**
